In this workshop, I've learned the importance of modular programming and code organization using header and implementation files. By breaking code into modules, we enhance maintainability and readability.
To avoid issues like the one-definition rule, we must ensure unique safeguard names in header files. These safeguards prevent multiple inclusions. 
The compilation process involves preprocessing, individual compilation of .cpp files, and linking binaries to execute the program. 
An important highlight is that safeguard names must be distinct to avoid conflicts. 
This workshop highlighted the significance of well-structured code, preventing errors, and facilitating smoother development.
